# Abstract

The first aim of this study is to define soft topological spaces and to define soft continuity of soft mappings. Second is to introduce soft product topology and study properties of soft projection mappings. Third is to define soft compactness and generalize Alexander subbase theorem and Tychonoff theorem to the soft topological spaces.
# 1. Introduction

In 1999 Molodtsov initiated the novel concept of soft set theory which is completely new approach for modelling, vagueness and uncertainties. Lattice-ordered sets abound in mathematics and its applications, and many authors do not distinguish between them and lattices. From a universal algebraist's point of view, however, a lattice is different from a lattice-ordered set because lattices are algebraic structures that form an equational class or variety, but lattice-ordered sets are not algebraic structures, and therefore do not form a variety.

Soft Lattice topological spaces (Soft L-topological spaces or Soft L-space) are defined over an initial universe X with a fixed set of parameters P. We discuss some basic properties of soft L-topological spaces and define soft L-open and soft L-closed sets. The soft L-closure of a soft lattice is defined which is, in fact, a generalisation of closure of a set in a broader sense. The newly introduced concept of parameters comes into play with the collection of parameterised topologies on the initial universe. Corresponding to each parameter, we get a topological space and this makes the involvement of parameters more significant. We can say that a soft topological space gives a parameterised family of topologies on the initial universe but the converse is not true i.e. we cannot construct a soft topological space if we are given some topologies for each parameter. Consequently we can say that the soft topological spaces are more generalised than the classical topological spaces.

During the process of theory development, we also see that the properties of parameterised topologies correspond to that of soft topological spaces in some particular situations. Similarly, Soft Lattice topological space is more generalised than Soft topological space.
